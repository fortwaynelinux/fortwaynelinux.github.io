We at the Fort Wayne Linux Users Group have been struggling to decide on a path forward for holding events safely, during this health crisis. Continuing to kick the can down the road by cancelling in-person events, month after month, waiting for the situation to improve, contributes nothing toward fulfilling our mission. So, we will commence holding online events soon. Decisions on the exact nature of these events and the platform(s) on which they will take place have yet to be finalized. Keep an eye on this space for details to come.
