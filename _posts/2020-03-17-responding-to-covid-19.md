To slow the spread of COVID-19, all restaurants and bars in Indiana have been ordered to close for dine-in patrons. As such, our regular venue for the monthly social is no longer available.

Similarly, the library has closed its meeting rooms. They might be available again in time for our next presentation, but they will likely impose an attendance limit, and it has long been our policy not to exclude anyone from attending our events.

While we could still hold events in a public place like a park, experts are advising everyone to avoid unnecessary public outings of any kind.

The health an well-being of our members is important to us, so we are cancelling all events until further notice. We hope you understand our reasons for doing this.

If you would like to get involved in actively helping to fight this virus, the Folding@Home project makes that possible without risking your health. If you have a computer sitting around idle, particularly one with a discrete GPU, and you can spare the electricity, visit the link below to learn how you can donate processor time to help develop a vaccine.
